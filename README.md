### Routes

- /api/diagonal/:divis_kind/:country_iso
 
Called from function: `fetch_matrix_then_draw`
 
Fetches diagonal of the mobility matrix. i.e. the number of people who've made two calls from the same tower. We think this is a measure of population density. It's a dynamic estimate. It changes from day.

Currently fetches matrix for one single day

The max value of the Diagonal of matrix is used to normalize all diagonal values. These values are used in the opacity of polygon colors to represent population density.


- /api/division/:divis_kind/:country_iso

Called from function: `fetch_geojson_for_divisions`

Fetches geojson for either admin 2 polygons or voranoi cells to be displayed on map.

TODO(mikefab): Change 'division' to 'geojson'
